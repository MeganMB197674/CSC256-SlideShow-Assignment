            <h2>Sedona ... McDonald's? (Yum!)</h2>
            <div class="text">You may be wondering why these McDonald's arches aren't gold. Well, according to the internet and Sedona locals, 
                the classic golden color 'clashes' with the natural red tone of the rocks here. Because of this, the local Sedona McDonald's chose
                to use turquois for their arches! Because of this odd color choice, the Sedona McDonald's has become a popular tourist destination.
                Funny, isn't it?

            <h2>A 'Cairn' I Created in Sedona</h2>
            <div class="text">
                This may look like just a neat tower of rocks, but this is actually a human made formation of stones referred to as a 'cairn.'
                I first discovered cairns while doing one of my favorite passtimes, playing video games. In real life and as depicted in some 
                games, cairns are placed in order to mark paths for travel, as a spiritual symbol of faith, and alike this one that I built, 
                they are built as a way to say: "I am here. I have lived.”(Kelleher, 2021)

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rock cairns are easier to spot in green grass and dirt, but hard to spot in the desert, as the rocks match the landscape. (Zion National Park, 2021)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is illegal to make these cairns inside a national park, as it can disrupt hikers, natural habitats of insects, and worsen erosion. (Zion National Park, 2021)

            <h2>Organ Pipe Cactus</h2>
            <div class="text">
                This photo of an Organ Pipe Cactus was taken at the Sonoran Desert Museum in Tucson, Arizona. When we think of cacti, we normally think
                of the famous Saguaro cactus you see on television all the time, featuring a straight main stalk and arms that reach for the sky.
                Unlike the Saguaro cactus, the Organ Pipe looks more like an octopus. 
                <h3>Fun Facts!</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "Organ Pipe Cactus can live to over 150 years in age, and will only produce their first flower near the age of 35." (NPS.gov, 2015) 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organ Pipe Cacti bloom white flowers that only stay open at night, which allows bats to do most of the pollination. (NPS.gov, 2015)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Sub-freezing temperatures will kill young tissue at the end of the stems. When growth begins again, the results are indentations,
                        or the appearance of circular waves on the organ pipes." (NPS.gov, 2015)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The main area in the country that these cacti grow is in the Organ Pipe National Monument of Arizona, which houses the perfect climate and geological setting. (NPS.gov, 2015)

            <h2>The Grand Canyon: South Rim Lookout</h2>
            <div class="text">
                This photo was taken in March of 2019 at the south rim lookout inside of the Grand Canyon National Park. People can be seen standing on a nearby cliff - but 
                the interesting part is - this cliff has no railing, as it is NOT part of the designated lookout site. I was in some shock taking this, as many people 
                have fallen off of the canyon cliffs according to park rangers. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful sight, with rock colors ranging from the tan and beige tone
                seen in this photo, to green plant life, to crimson and brown.

                        "On average, two to three deaths per year are from accidental falls over the rim, park spokeswoman Kirby-Lynn Shedlowski says." (Wadzinski, 2023)

                    <li>
                        The grand Canyon was carved over 6 million years ago by geological activity and the Colorado River, which runs through the bottom of the canyon. (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2021)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "An estimated 5.9 million people visit the Grand Canyon a year, making it the second most popular national park following just behind the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee." (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2021)

                    <li>
                        The most dangerous animal in the park is a squirrel? Yes, you read that right. The Rock Squirrel is known to attack dozens of visitors that attempt to feed these cute little mammals. (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2021)

            <h2>Papillon Helicopter Tours</h2>
            <div class="text">
                This photo was taken moments before my father and I took flight on a Papillon Helicopter tour! This tour took us over the south rim of the Grand Canyon, 
                allowing us to view buffalo, rams, plant life, rock formations, caves, and the Colorado River! It is a much needed adventure that I recommend everyone take 
                at some point if they can. The tour lasted around 30 minutes. During the tour, passengers wear headphones equipped with microphones that allow them to speak 
                with one another and the pilot. Although, I think that the best part of the tour was the song "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong playing as we 
                went over the canyon. Needless to say, everyone cried a bit.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        According to the pilots of the Papillon tours, there is an albino buffalo roaming the canyon. It is highly protected by the park rangers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The temperature in the winter and spring seasons can drop extremely low, oftentimes covering the canyon with frost and snow. This makes for a 
                        beautiful sight atop of the red rock.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you decide to take one of these helicopter tours, they are offered in increments of 15 minutes and allow you to choose from the south rim of the canyon,
                        north rim (which is more tan and closer to the Hoover Dam), and into Las Vegas as well.

                This is the star of the show, the cause of it all, and a very interesting rock! (Believe it or not). This meteor, comprised of iron, struck the earth 
                hard enough to be compared to the force of a nuclear blast and excavated 175 million tons of rock upon impact. (Kring & Bailey, 2023)
